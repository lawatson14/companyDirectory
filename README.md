# companyDirectory

A simple project to practice and demonstrate my understanding of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions and server interactions.

This project is designed to be used as 'Company Directory', for a business to create and maintain the information on their staff, departments and locations. In light of this, CRUD functionallity has been provided to each area of the directory. Furthermore safeguards have been put in place to prevent accidental deletion of a record which other records depend upon.  

Similar to all my other projects, this app is designed to be mobile first while working equally well on desktop pcs. I have opted for a simplistic layout to highlight user functionality. Addition regex & form sanitation has been included alongside response alerts to improve user experience and safeguard the app from incorrect dat type being submitted.

This app includes the following scripting languages: 
  HTML
  CSS (bootstrap)
  JS (ajax, json, jQuery)
  PHP
  MySQL
